## Contributing
We welcome external contributors or anyone excited to help improve 100ms SDKs. If you'd like to get involved, check out our [contribution guide](./DEVELOPER.MD), and get started exploring the codebase.

### Local Setup

> Node version 18.0.0 or later

if you are using a different version in other projects, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) to manage node versions.


```
git clone https://github.com/100mslive/web-sdks.git
cd web-sdks
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Running Sample Prebuilt

```
cd examples/prebuilt-react-integration
yarn dev
```

`http://locahost:<port>/<room-code>`

Once you run `yarn dev`, the localhost link with the port will be generated automatically. Just get the roomCode from [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live) and append at the end


### Testing Changes Locally
Run `yarn start` by navigating to the package you are making changes to, the changes should reflect in the above sample app.

For example, if you are making changes in roomkit-react(prebuilt), run `yarn start` in that package. The sample app should auto reload.

> Note: Make sure `yarn build` is run atleast once before using `yarn start`

|--|--|--|--|
| `roomkit-react`  | `@100mslive/roomkit-react`| This contains the React components used in the prebuilt and the Prebuilt component itself.  | [README](https://github.com/100mslive/web-sdks/blob/main/packages/roomkit-react/README.md) |
