## How to integrate?

The 100ms SDK gives you everything you need to build scalable, high-quality live video and audio experiences.

**There are two ways you can add 100ms to your apps:**

1. ## Custom UI
   - 100ms SDKs are powerful and highly extensible to build and support all custom experiences and UI.
   - **Related packages include:** `@100mslive/react-sdk`, `@100mslive/hms-video-store` and `@100mslive/react-icons`.
   - Get started with integrating the SDK using the [How to Guide](https://www.100ms.live/docs/javascript/v2/how-to-guides/install-the-sdk/integration).

> Navigate to `react-sdk` for the base React Hooks and some commonly used functionalities by clicking [here](./packages/react-sdk).

2.  ## 100ms Prebuilt
    - 100ms Prebuilt is a high-level abstraction with no-code customization that enables you to embed video conferencing and/or live streaming UIâ€”with a few lines of code.
    - **Related packages include:** `roomkit-react` and `roomkit-web`.
    - Get started with 100ms Prebuilt using the [Prebuilt Quickstart for Web](https://www.100ms.live/docs/javascript/v2/quickstart/prebuilt-quickstart).

> Navigate to `roomkit-react` for the React components used in Prebuilt and the Prebuilt component itself by clicking [here](./packages/roomkit-react).

## Setup

### Local Setup

> Node version 18.0.0 or later

if you are using a different version in other projects, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) to manage node versions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/100mslive/web-sdks.git
cd web-sdks
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Running Sample Prebuilt

```bash
cd examples/prebuilt-react-integration
yarn dev
```

`http://locahost:<port>/<room-code>`

Once you run `yarn dev`, the localhost link with the port will be generated automatically. Just get the roomCode from [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live) and append at the end

### Testing Changes Locally

Run `yarn start` by navigating to the package you are making changes to, the changes should reflect in the above sample app.

For example, if you are making changes in roomkit-react(prebuilt), run `yarn start` in that package. The sample app should auto reload.

> Note: Make sure `yarn build` is run atleast once before using `yarn start`.

### Deploying Your Changes

Once you have forked the repository and tested your changes on the local build, you can follow the steps below to deploy to Vercel as an example:

- Import the fork repository
- Set `examples/prebuilt-react-integration` as the root directory
- Use the Create React App preset and update the build and install commands `Project Settings` to use the root level scripts
  - install: `cd ../../ && yarn install`
  - build: `cd ../../ && yarn build`

For reference:

![Project Settings](./project-settings.png)


Once the app has been deployed, you can append the room code at the end of the deployment URL to preview your changes

### Maintaining A Forked Version

The following command will build the roomkit-react package and generate a .tgz file:

```bash
yarn && yarn build;
cd packages/roomkit-react;
yarn pack
```

Push your changes and the .tgz file to the forked repository and in the package.json of the app you are building, use the following link for the roomkit-react package:

```
"@100mslive/roomkit-react":"https://github.com/<user_name>/web-sdks/raw/main/packages/roomkit-react/<tgz_file_name>.tgz",
```

Re-install the dependencies after updating the package.json and build using the following command:

```
yarn && yarn build
```

You can now import the HMSPrebuilt component in the same way as before:

```
import { HMSPrebuilt } from '@100mslive/roomkit-react';
```
