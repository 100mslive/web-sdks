## How to integrate?
The 100ms SDK gives you everything you need to build scalable, high-quality live video and audio experiences. 

**There are two ways you can add 100ms to your apps:**

1. ## Custom UI
	-	100ms SDKs are powerful and highly extensible to build and support all custom experiences and UI.
	-	**Related packages include:** `@100mslive/react-sdk`, `@100mslive/hms-video-store` and `@100mslive/react-icons`.
	-	Get started with integrating the SDK using the [How to Guide](https://www.100ms.live/docs/javascript/v2/how-to-guides/install-the-sdk/integration). <br>

> Navigate to `react-sdk` for the base React Hooks and some commonly used functionalities by clicking [here](./packages/react-sdk).

2.  ## 100ms Prebuilt 
	- 100ms Prebuilt is a high-level abstraction with no-code customization that enables you to embed video conferencing and/or live streaming UIâ€”with a few lines of code.
	- **Related packages include:** `roomkit-react` and `roomkit-web`.
	- Get started with 100ms Prebuilt using the [Prebuilt Quickstart for Web](https://www.100ms.live/docs/javascript/v2/quickstart/prebuilt-quickstart). <br>

## Setup

### Local Setup

> Node version 18.0.0 or later

if you are using a different version in other projects, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) to manage node versions.


```
git clone https://github.com/100mslive/web-sdks.git
cd web-sdks
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Running Sample Prebuilt

```
cd examples/prebuilt-react-integration
yarn dev
```

`http://locahost:<port>/<room-code>`

Once you run `yarn dev`, the localhost link with the port will be generated automatically. Just get the roomCode from [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live) and append at the end


### Testing Changes Locally
Run `yarn start` by navigating to the package you are making changes to, the changes should reflect in the above sample app.

For example, if you are making changes in roomkit-react(prebuilt), run `yarn start` in that package. The sample app should auto reload.

> Note: Make sure `yarn build` is run atleast once before using `yarn start`
