# Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories.

For example:

import { Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';

## Dialog

Dialog is an hover component used to have a focus-mode like UI for users.
