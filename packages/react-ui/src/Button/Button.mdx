# Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories.

For example:

import { Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';

## Button

Button is the primary component. It has four possible states.

- [Primary](#primary)
- [Standard](#standard)
- [Danger](#danger)
- [With Icon](#with-icon)

### Primary

<Story id="button--primary" />

### Standard

<Story id="button--standard" />

### Danger

<Story id="button--danger" />

### With Icon

<Story id="button--icon" />
