## Overview

PIP(Picture-in-picture) allows websites to create a floating video window always on top of other windows so that users may continue 
consuming media while they interact with other content sites, or applications on their device.

## Sample Usage:

```jsx

import { PIPComponent } from '@100mslive/react-ui';

function SomeComponent() {
    return (
      <PIPComponent />
    );
}

```
