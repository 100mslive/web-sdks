## useScreenShare

This hook can be used to implement a screenshare toggle button as well as know about the screenshare in the room.
This works best if your application only needs to show one screenshare in large view at a time with other screenshares
similar to normal user tiles.
For any complicated requirement with multiple screenshares it's best to use the store directly.
For viewing the screenshare this hook is best used in combination with useVideo.
For implementing control bar for local peer, this is used based with useAVToggle.

### Interface


```jsx
interface useScreenShareInput {
 /**
  * to handle any error during toggle of audio/video
  */
  handleError: (err: Error, method?: string) => void;
}
```

```jsx
interface useScreenShareResult {
  /**
   * true if the local user is screensharing, false otherwise
   */
  amIScreenSharing: boolean;
  /**
   * toggle screenshare for the local user, will only be present if the user has the permission to toggle
   */
  toggleScreenShare?: () => void;
  /**
   * the id of the peer who is currently screensharing, will only be present if there is a screenshare in the room.
   * In case of multiple screenshares, the behaviour of which one is picked is not defined.
   */
  screenSharingPeerId?: HMSPeerID;
  /**
   * the name of the peer who is currently screensharing. Will be undefined if no one is sharing the screen.
   * In case of multiple screenshares, the behavior of which one is picked is not defined.
   */
  screenSharingPeerName?: string;
  /**
   * screenShare audio track id, will only be present if there is a screenshare with video track
   */
  screenShareVideoTrackId?: HMSTrackID;
  /**
   * screenShare audio track id, will only be present if there is a screenshare with audio track
   */
  screenShareAudioTrackId?: HMSTrackID;
}
```
