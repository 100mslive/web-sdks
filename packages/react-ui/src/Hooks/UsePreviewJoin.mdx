### usePreviewJoin

This hook can be used to build a preview UI component, this lets you call preview everytime the passed in
token changes. This hook is best used in combination with useDevices for changing devices, useAVToggle for
muting/unmuting and useAudioLevelStyles for showing mic audio level to the user.
Any device change or mute/unmute will be carried across to join.

### Interface

```jsx
import { HMSConfigInitialSettings } from '@100mslive/hms-video-store';
import { hooksErrHandler } from '@100mslive/react-sdk';
export interface usePreviewInput {
  /**
   * name of user who is joining, this is only required if join is called
   */
  name?: string;
  /**
   * app side authentication token
   */
  token: string;
  /**
   * any extra metadata info for the peer
   */
  metadata?: string;
  /**
   * function to handle errors happening during preview
   */
  handleError?: hooksErrHandler;
  initEndpoint?: string;
  /**
   * initial settings for audio/video and device to be used.
   */
  initialSettings?: HMSConfigInitialSettings;
  /**
   * Enable to get a network quality score while in preview. The score ranges from -1 to 5.
   * -1 when we are not able to connect to 100ms servers within an expected time limit
   * 0 when there is a timeout/failure when measuring the quality
   * 1-5 ranges from poor to good quality.
   */
  captureNetworkQualityInPreview?: boolean;
}
```

```jsx
export interface usePreviewResult {
  /**
   * enable the join button for the user only when this is true
   */
  enableJoin: boolean;
  /**
   * call this function to join the room
   */
  join: () => Promise<void>;
  /**
   * once the user has joined the room, till leave happens this flag will be true. It can be used
   * to decide to show between preview form and conferencing component/video tiles.
   */
  isConnected: boolean;
  /**
   * call this function to join the room
   */
  preview: () => Promise<void>;
}
```
